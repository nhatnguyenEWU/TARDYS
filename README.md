# TARDYS
This is my research on TARDYS Quantifiers: Extracting Temporal and Reversible DYnamical Symmetries. Publication can be found here: https://doi.org/10.3390/photonics9120938

You can check out the pdf slides and a snippet of the MATLAB code that Dr. Andres Aragoneses and I used to analyze the data from a semiconductor laser with external optical feedback and reveal some hidden symmetries within the complex system. From the results, we can use the TARDYS as a powerful tool to extract key information in complex system dynamics to make decisions and predictions.
